# Networking and Servers

## How the internet works
### It's a chain:
    - Web browser presents info to you, which it sourced from the computer, iPad, or phone, which it sourced from the router (wifi-wired).
    - This router comes through cable, which is sourced from the Internet, which contains a ton of web servers full of html files (all of which comprise a wesbite)
    
## Client-Server Architecture
### Request and Response
    - Starting from a server, the server connects to the internet which then connects to clients who are using devies

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
    - Protocol that allows resources to be requested and sent on the internet
    - Types of requests: GET, POST, PUT & PATCH, DELETE
    - Responses: 404, 502, etc.
