# UX/UI Design

## Notes
### Usability
- Measure of how effectively a person can navigate an interface, find info, and achieve specific goals
- Improving usability is part of human-computer interaction
- Aesthetic trends are volatile, but usability remains
#### Common web usability problems:
    - Long text that takes a while to read
    - Cluttered
    - Requires horizontal scrolling (like a bad use of flet andjust using margins, which is something everyone has done and might keep doing if flexbox is misbehaving)
    - Poor color choice and/or controls/navigation
#### Common web usability problems:
    - Most important content not on first page @ quick access
    - Nondescript headings
    - Things that look like ads or actual ads
    - Tough to index by search engine
    - Tiny thumbnails of large photos

- On phones, having things that need to be touched at bottom is ideal since it is at the user's thumb tips
- Avoid requiring 3+ clicks for anything (info, images, links, etc., just any stuff)
- Pay attention to how items can appear different on varying search engines, devices, etc.

## Exercise
### Website #7, Tag Team Signs
- Text is too big
- Bad color pairing choice: Black on red choic isn't the best pair to contrast. Very hard to read. There is also a section with red text over a background with white text--bad contrast, hard to read.
- Have to scroll too much

### Other sites:
- Color contrast is bad
- Too much clutter on one page
- Too much scrolling, sometimes horizontal
- Poor/no nav bar
