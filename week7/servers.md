# Accessibility
## Notes
### What is it and why is it needed?
- Allowing anyone, regardless of ability, to use a site
- Important to consider when developing a page, becuase page  needs to be inclusive
### Examples of disabilities:
- Vision (blindness, low-vision, color blindness)
- Hearing (deafness, high frequency loss)
- Movement (paralysis, amputees, chronic injuries)
- Difficulty reading (dyslexia, lower literacy)
### Assistive technologies:
#### Screen Readers
- Change visual display into audio output 
    - Scan window and read things in chronological order
    - Some take HTML structure
    - Useful for those with vision or literacy difficulties
- Braille displays
    - Provide output as Braille rather than audio
    - Useful for the blind and deaf
- Effects of these:
    - Web page is reduced to text
    - Browsing is a time-based experience

#### Screen Magnifiers
- Simple solutions
    - Increasing font size in browser
    - Zoom into page
- Large scale magnification
    - Might cause loss of context
    - Might make page difficult to use especially if there is a lot of blank space
- Apple Hover Text
#### Screen reader mode
- Simple Alternatives like sticky/slow keys
- Uses
    - Some users can't use mouse or keyboard (need on-screen accessories)
    - Keybaords are difficult to use on mobile devices
 - Navigate with only keyboard
    - Keyboard as mouse
    - Other devices simulate keyboard input
    - Tab sequence should be valid and logical

### Color Contrast
- There's a ratio to measure how successful a color contrast is to be able to be identified by a person with vision problems
- Goal ratio is at least 5:1
- Passing ratios: AA-5:1 and AAA-7:1
